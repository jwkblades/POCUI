## POC UI - Proof Of Concept User Interface

This repository acts as a collection of minimal POCs for various UIs that I have
seen around the web, or in videos, and thought would be interesting to make.
They are primarily meant for learning, and not packaged in any immediately
pluggable library/ component.

### How it works

Each file is a self-contained example. Just open it up in your web browser, and
it should work.

**NOTE**: I do not verify that all examples are cross-browser compatible. Most
of them are written in Firefox, so they work there. This also means the examples
won't be using features that Firefox doesn't support.
